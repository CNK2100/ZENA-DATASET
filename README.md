# Z-Wave Devices Traffic Dataset

This is the pre-processed dataset used in the paper:" ZENA.

The dataset can be used to test cybersecurity applications, Ai-based IDS, threat intelligence, and adversarial machine learning that target the Z-Wave protocol.

ZENA dataset includes heterogeneous real Z-Wave devices traffic such as the main controller, several slaves' devices, actuators, and sensors.

The dataset consists of normal (benign) traffic and abnormal (attack) traffic collected from known Z-Wave vulnerabilities and fuzzing techniques.
